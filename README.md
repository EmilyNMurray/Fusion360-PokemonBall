# Fusion360-PokemonBall
Fusion360 file for a Standard Pokemon Ball- very basic with no hinge open

First experience with 3D modeling software and created for learning purposes. 
Used tools from the 'Direct' and 'Freeform' categories.
Will be periodically updated. Next update to include hinge opening.
